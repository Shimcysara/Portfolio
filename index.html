            <h3>Project 1.ATM Interface using Python</h3>
            <p>
                A simple ATM interface built using Python. The project simulates basic ATM functionalities like balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history. 
                It uses Python’s OOP concepts to handle user accounts securely and efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Project 2.QR Code Generator Using Python</h3>
            <p>
                A Python application that generates QR codes from user-provided data (e.g., URLs, text, or contact information).
                It utilizes the <code>qrcode</code> library to create customized QR codes that can be easily saved as image files.
                This project helped me understand how to integrate Python libraries for data encoding and image generation.

        <h3>Python Timer Project</h3>
        <p>
            This Python-based timer allows users to set a countdown timer or stopwatch directly from the terminal. 
            It includes functionalities for starting, pausing, and resetting the timer. The project was built using 
            Python’s time library and demonstrates basic concepts like loops, functions, and user input handling.
